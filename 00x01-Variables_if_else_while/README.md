# Fundamentals of C Programming

This repository covers the essentials of the C programming language, providing the foundational understanding necessary for writing efficient code. Key topics include:

- Understanding operators
- Control structures
- Managing variables
- Commenting and documentation
- Character encoding
- Compilation options

### Operators

- **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical calculations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
- **Logical Operators**: Combine or invert boolean expressions (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
- **Relational Operators**: Compare values and return boolean results (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
- **Boolean Operators**: Logical operators that operate on boolean values, commonly used in conditions.

**Truth Values**: In C, any non-zero value is considered `TRUE`, while `0` is `FALSE`.

### Control Structures

- **`if` and `if ... else` Statements**: Execute blocks of code based on conditions.
- **Comments**: Non-executable text for explanations (`//` for single-line, `/* ... */` for multi-line).

### Variables

- **Variable Declaration**: Variables are declared by specifying the type (`char`, `int`, `unsigned int`).
- **Variable Assignment**: Values are assigned using the `=` operator.
- **Printing Values**: Use `printf` with format specifiers to print variable values (`%c`, `%d`, `%u`).

### Loops

- **`while` Loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.

### ASCII Character Set

An encoding standard representing text characters with numerical values (0-127).

### Compilation Options

- **GCC Flags**:
  - `-m32`: Compiles for a 32-bit architecture.
  - `-m64`: Compiles for a 64-bit architecture.
