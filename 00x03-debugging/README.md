# Debugging

Debugging is the process of identifying, isolating, and fixing bugs or errors in a program to ensure it runs smoothly and correctly.

## Methods of Debugging Manually:

* **Print Statements**: Inserting print statements to track variable values and program flow.
* **Code Review**: Carefully reviewing code to spot logical errors or inconsistencies.
* **Step-by-Step Execution**: Running the program line by line to observe behavior and state changes.
* **Using Debuggers**: Utilizing debugging tools that allow you to set breakpoints and inspect the program state.

## How to Read Error Messages:

Error messages provide crucial information about issues in the code.

* **Error Type**: Understand the type of error (syntax, runtime, etc.).
* **Line Number**: Locate the line number indicated in the message for quick reference.
* **Description**: Analyze the description for clues about what went wrong and possible solutions.

| File Name              | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0-main.c               | Tests that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of 0. |
| 1-main.c               | Commented out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop. |
| 2-largest_number.c     | Fixed the program so that it correctly prints out the largest of three integers. |
| 3-print_remaining_days.c| Fixed the function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years. |
| main.h                 | The header file.                                                  |
