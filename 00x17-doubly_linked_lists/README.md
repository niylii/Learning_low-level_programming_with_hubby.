# Doubly Linked List

## What is a Doubly Linked List?

A **doubly linked list** is a type of data structure that consists of nodes, where each node contains three components:

1. **Data**: The value stored in the node.
2. **Next Pointer**: A reference to the next node in the sequence.
3. **Previous Pointer**: A reference to the previous node in the sequence.

This structure allows traversal in both forward and backward directions, making operations like insertion and deletion more efficient in certain scenarios compared to singly linked lists.

## How to Use Doubly Linked Lists

Doubly linked lists can be utilized in various applications, such as:

- Implementing data structures like stacks and queues.
- Navigating through data in both directions.
- Managing complex data in applications like web browsers (back and forward navigation).

## Operations on Doubly Linked Lists

- **Insertion**: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or any specific position.
- **Deletion**: Removing a node from the list.
- **Traversal**: Visiting each node in the list in both forward and backward directions.
- **Searching**: Finding a node with a specific value.
